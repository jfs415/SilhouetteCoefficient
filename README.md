# SilhouetteCoefficient

## Changes made to arff files:
Removed the class attribute from the datasets before saving the clustering output generated in Weka.

## Summary:
Calculates euclidean distance, cohesion and separation values for each data point. 
The silhouette coefficient of each cluster is then computed using these values.
